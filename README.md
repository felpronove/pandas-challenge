Analysis #1
One surprising finding that came from the analysis is the impact of spending per student on the student's grades. Logically, spending more money on a student would lead to higher grades. However, when we sorted the data by the school's spending range, the opposite seems to be true. It seems like the more a school spent on a student, the worse they got. This along with the trend of smaller school sizes leading to better grades, indicates that the key to successful students might not necessarily be the resources available to teachers and students, but the availability of teachers for to focus on their students on a one on one basis. 

The ability for students to get dedicated assistance and aid tailored to their needs, the better students do.

Analysis #2
Student grades don't change significantly as the years progress. Across all schools, the average math and reading grades remain relatively constant. Although, some outliers could appear (student grades dropping or rising by a significant amount) this indicates that as a whole students don't see a significant improvement in grades as their go through high school. As students go through high school, high achieving students will continue to achieve at a high level and vice versa. This indicates if parents or teachers want to improve a student's ability to get good grades, they should focus on installing good habits at an earlier age (middle school or elementary school).
